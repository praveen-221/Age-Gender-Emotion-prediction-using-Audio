- Project work as a part of Machine Learning Course CS6301
- Dataset: <a href="https://github.com/Sadekeen20/cleaned-dataset-gender-age-emotion" target="_blank">Github Link</a> 

1) A system to detect gender, age, and emotion from speech and Audio Features. 
2) Ten different machine learning algorithms are applied for predicting gender, age, and emotion. 
3) A comprehensive evaluation of all the machine learning models in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score to be carried out to find the best predictive model
4) Use of Chi-squared test for feature selection
